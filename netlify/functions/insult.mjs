/*
 * insult.mjs — Netlify serverless function (v2) that returns a 404 roast.
 *
 * Endpoint: GET /.netlify/functions/insult
 * Returns:  { insult: string, source: "groq" | "fallback" }
 *
 * The function calls the Groq API (a free LLM provider) for a witty
 * one-liner about the user's missing page. If anything goes wrong —
 * missing key, rate limit, network failure, malformed response — it
 * returns one of FALLBACK_INSULTS so the user always sees something.
 * This "always return something useful" pattern is called graceful
 * degradation, and it's the single most important rule for code that
 * depends on a third-party API.
 *
 * Netlify Functions v2 uses standard Web APIs: the handler receives a
 * Request object and must return a Response (or a Promise of one).
 * No callbacks, no res.send() — this is the same Request/Response API
 * the browser's fetch() uses.

/*
 * getConfig() reads environment variables at call time, not at module load.
 *
 * Why this matters: module-level constants are evaluated once when Node
 * first imports the file. That makes them impossible to test — you can't
 * change process.env between tests and re-run the same module. By reading
 * env vars inside a function, each call sees the current environment.
 *
 * allowedOrigin — the only origin the function will serve.
 *
 * Production: must be set explicitly in Netlify dashboard env (SITE_URL).
 * Local dev:  defaults to http://localhost:8888 when running under `ntl dev`,
 *             so a fresh clone works without any local configuration.
 *
 * If you run `ntl dev` on a non-default port, set SITE_URL in your shell
 * (e.g. `SITE_URL=http://localhost:9000 ntl dev`).
 *
 * The two-tier design (env var preferred, dev default fallback) is a
 * common pattern: production stays strict (fail closed if misconfigured)
 * while local dev "just works" with no extra setup.
 *
 * CORS headers tell the browser which origins may read this response.
 * Setting Access-Control-Allow-Origin to a single value (not "*") means
 * only that one origin can fetch from this function via a browser.
 *
 * The spread operator `...` here conditionally adds the ACAO header only
 * when allowedOrigin is defined. Spreading {} is a no-op, so this is a
 * common idiom for "include this property only if X is truthy."
 *
